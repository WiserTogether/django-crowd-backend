Django Crowd Authentication Backend
===================================

This is the most basic authentication backend connecting crowd 
and django. 
I am a django-dummy therefore no fancy easy_install or whatever
installation. 
Installation is easy. Just copy those files next to yours and 
add 
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ('crowd.CrowdBackend.CrowdBackend',) 
to your settings.py. There are some config options:

'AUTH_CROWD_ALWAYS_UPDATE_USER': True,
'AUTH_CROWD_MIRROR_GROUPS': True,
'AUTH_CROWD_STAFF_GROUP': 'staff',
'AUTH_CROWD_SUPERUSER_GROUP': 'superuser',
'AUTH_CROWD_SERVER_URI': 'http://127.0.0.1:8095/crowd/services/SecurityServer?wsdl'
 
The first two don't really work. But I planned to make them work.
